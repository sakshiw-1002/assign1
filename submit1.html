            <h3>ATTITUDE</h3>
            <p>
                In psychology, attitude is a psychological construct, a mental and emotional entity that inheres in, or characterizes a person.
                They are complex and are an acquired state through experiences. It is an individual's predisposed state of mind regarding a value 
                and it is precipitated through a responsive expression towards oneself, a person, place, thing, or event (the attitude object)
                which in turn influences the individual's thought and action. Prominent psychologist Gordon Allport described this latent
                psychological construct as "the most distinctive and indispensable concept in contemporary social psychology."
                Attitude can be formed from a person's past and present. Key topics in the study of attitudes include attitude strength, 
                attitude change, consumer behavior, and attitude-behavior relationships.

            <h3>CONFIDENCE</h3>
            <p>
                Confidence is a state of being certain either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct or that a chosen course of
                 action is the best or most effective. Confidence comes from a latin word fidere' which means "to trust"; therefore, 
                 having a self-confidence is having trust in one's self.
